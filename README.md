# Income-Data-Project
With college tuition, in the United States, seemingly rising exponentially higher than contemporary stagnent wages, I wanted to conduct a brief study on the effects that educational attainment have on one's salary potential. In this manner, we can get a general idea of how the monetary utility of a college degree reflects the rising costs of obtaining one. The data frame I will be working with comes from IPUMS - USA, and the microdata used was supplied through censuses and surveys throughout the 2017 and 2018 years.
